<p>First of all, I am super excited about <a href="http://devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> and will be joining San Francisco cohort starting June 23 2014 .
<br/><br/></p>

<h3>So, <a href="http://devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Boot What</a>?</h3>

<p>This code snippet should explain you everything:-</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">dev_bootcamp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">you</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">you</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> will be a Jr. Dev in 9 weeks!"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1">#For Example</span>
<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">dev_bootcamp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Puru Dahal"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">#=&gt; Puru Dahal will be a Jr. Dev in 9 weeks!</span>

</pre>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>How did it all started?</h3>

<p>I had basic understanding of HTMl/CSS, UX and Databases. I gathered these knowledge while working at HostGator for 6 months as Jr. Linux Admin. As much as I liked customer service and technical support position, I always was/am passionate about software development. So I started designing/developing websites of my own. I designed couple of web pages with <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> I installed LAMP server on my computer to learn web designing with Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>After I quit the job with Hostgator, I build a ecommerce store all myself with <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>. This store of mine was based on drop-ship. If you do not know what drop-ship is, its a system where you would list the items for sell without physically owning the inventory. After the items are sold, you would notify the vendors and they would take care of the handling and shipping for you. Obviously you do not make as much profit as you would when you have the inventory yourself, but there is no risk involved when it comes to buying/storing and not selling the inventory.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>While drop shipping does not involve risk, it comes with lot of hassles of manually emailing/calling/faxing vendors to notify of sales and returns. If you have few orders, this is not much of a problem if you have few sales and returns. Before this became one person&#39;s full time job, I was thinking of a solution to this problem, there was none available on Shopify&#39;s App Store. So I thought to myself:-</p>

<p><br/></p>

<blockquote>
<p><i class = "fa fa-question text-danger"></i> Why not I build an app myself?<br/>
<i class = "fa fa-question text-danger"></i> What it takes to build such app?<br/>
<i class = "fa fa-usd text-success"></i> I probably monazite that app and let others use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br/></p>

<p>As I was digging in, I found out that I needed some way to call their api and play around with it. The whole thing was new to me.</p>

<p>So again, I thought to myself... May be I am not ready yet. May be I should learn first before I jump to any of these. Thats when I began learning Ruby on Rails so I can develop/design a product, not just be a consumer.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>But why Dev Bootcamp?</h3>

<p>I have taken few years of computer science classes and unfortunately I had to drop out because of my personal reasons (thats the story for some other day). After I took care of all those obstacles, it was time for me to decide whether to go back to school or learn programming on my own.</p>

<p><em>This made me think that...</em></p>

<p>I personally have experienced that you do not use 90% of the materials you study at school. Till date, I have never programmed in C++, Java which I spent 2 years learning at school. Besides, no offense, but most those professors who teaches you at schools graduated during 90&#39;s and the technology, tools and programming languages and other materials they teach you at school are all old fashioned and outdated. Thats all they know, thats all they teach you. And you hit this wall when you start learning on your own. The educational system of United States is broken, not just United States. No doubt, school teaches a lot of good things, but not the real life knowledge that you would need to get the job done after you graduate from school. School teaches you to run behind grades and GPA&#39;s. I remember taking two Java classes and two C++ classes at University. Which means I spent two years learning Programming at school, and what did I learn in return? I learned how to pass the exam by studying book a night before the quiz and exams. I learned how to memorize syntax by literally reading books and making flashcards. But I did not learn to program. </p>

<p><br/></p>

<h3>Why not learn on my own?</h3>

<p>While learning on my own, some of the things I did was not making any sense to me, and I would throw questions on Stack Overflow and wait for days, sometimes week to get any response, often times, people would not give me the answer but comment saying I need to take my question down or delete &quot;ruby&quot; tag because I was asking question about rails and I am not asking the questions in right way, and many ruby developers there including that person who commented do not code rails bla bla bla.... I know what you might be thinking, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with them, right?&quot; This was so frustrating and discouraging.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Thats when I decided to learn from real people, get involved in real community and dive into real world of programming with people with same, if not like mentality.&quot;</em></p>
